# CIFAR10 Image Recognition using PyTorch DNN - using Depthwise Separable Convolution and Dilated Convolution
The model architecture uses Depthwise Separable Convolution and Dilated Convolution layers in the network to reduce the
number of parameters. 

## Architecture
Architecture uses C1C2C3C40 (basically 3 MPs). It uses Depthwise Separable Convolution and Dilated Convolution layers.
It uses a Global Average Pooling and one Fully Connected Layer.

## Requirements
`Python 3.x` is required to run this. However, running on a Google Colab on a GPU Runtime is highly recommended.

## How to Run
Please run the Notebook 'eva_session7_assignment.ipynb' to see the architecture in the Notebook itself. 
See 'eva_sesssion7.ipynb' for the modular method call.
