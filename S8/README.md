# CIFAR10 Image Recognition using ResNet18 Architecture in PyTorch 

## Architecture
ResNet 18 is the architecture used. The model architecture code is thankfully borrowed from 
https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar/blob/master/models/resnet.py

## Requirements
`Python 3.x` is required to run this. However, running on a Google Colab on a GPU Runtime is highly recommended.

## How to Run
Please run the Notebook 'S8-Assignment.ipynb'
