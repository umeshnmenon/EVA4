# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition using PyTorch DNN
A simple Jupyter Notebook is made avaialable to try and test the MNIST Handwritten digit recognition using Deep Neural Network built using PyTorch.

Latest PyTorch version provides more flexiblity and control over the code compared to Keras. 

## Requirements
`Python 3.x` is required to run this. However, running on a Google Colab on a GPU Runtime is highly recommeded.

## Architecture
Please see the Notebook cell titled **Architecture** to know the  architecture used for this task.

## Result
We have achieved aroung 99.40 accuracy using the above architecture.
